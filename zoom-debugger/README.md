# Zoom Debugger

This is an experimental ZUI (zooming user interface) debugger. It allows
users to drill down into the activity of a function call by "zooming in"
similar to zooming in Google Earth.

## Introductory Videos

Here are three introductory videos about the zoom debugger:

* [Introducing the Deep-Zoom Debugger (5 minutes)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QE54x1ahHa4)
* [Deep-Zoom Debugger Demo with Huiqi Zhou (17 minutes)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVb9bt7wDy8&t)
* [Google-Earth-Like Zooming File Explorer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pXQTNxPharY&t)

## Running the Zoom Debugger

To run it:

`zoom <.history or .sqlite file>`

The history file supplied to the zoom debugger is a SQLite database containing the past states
of the executed program.

## Making Of

I have documented the work on this debugger as a [video series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzrWQt__R8Q&list=PLSq9OFrD2Q3Bp9T2SiAAxOF60VSbGAtHn).
