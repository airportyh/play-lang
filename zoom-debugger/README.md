# Zoom Debugger

This is an experimental ZUI (zooming user interface) debugger. It allows
users to drill down into the activity of a function call by "zooming in"
similar to zooming in Google Earth.

## The Making Of

See the video [Google-Earth-Like Zooming File Explorer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pXQTNxPharY&t) for an introduction.

I have documented the work on this debugger as a [video series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzrWQt__R8Q&list=PLSq9OFrD2Q3Bp9T2SiAAxOF60VSbGAtHn).
