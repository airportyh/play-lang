# Time Navigator

time_nav is an implementation of the terminal-based time-traveling debugger in
lieu of term-debugger. It is implemented in Python. The goals of this project are:

* Develop the code with the benefit of the Python debugger to experience what it's
like to use it for development (dog-fooding)
* Make improvements based on feedback of using the debugger
* Make a high quality terminal-based debugger
* Make a zoom-mode for this debugger as well
