# Time Traveling Debugger

This project is an attempt to build a usable, practical, and useful
*time-traveling* debugger. A time-traveling debugger works by recording
the each state in the execution of a program into a database - we call that
the history file - and then allowing the programmer to navigate through
this file to investigate the cause of bugs.
